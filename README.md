# ‚öôÔ∏è Query Answers

## How many entries can you store in your design?
The value currently set against MAX_BIDS is 30, and it can be changed at the time of deployment
##  How would you change your design if some hot item exceeds that limit?
Using Program-Derived Address (PDA) to place bids, We will increment the count present in the bid seed in PDA every time a bid is placed. This allows users to bid dynamically without worrying about the max limit. The bid seed contains (NFT mint, BidCount).


## How would you implement another feature that shows the bidding history of a user?

We will store the user's public key inside the bid PDA.On the frontend side, We will fetch the bids PDA and filter the ones having the same bidder address as the user.

## If it is allowed, would you consider storing the bidding history off-chain? Why or why not?

Yes, we can consider it saving off-chain, as it will reduce gas fees. This is because there can be hundreds of bids for a single item, and it can cost users to make a bid. Some users may avoid making bids, as they have to pay a fee even though they might not win the bid. On the other hand, as a con, keeping bidding history on-chain will make things transparent, as we will have an immutable track of each bid, and there will be no chance of bid manipulation.
